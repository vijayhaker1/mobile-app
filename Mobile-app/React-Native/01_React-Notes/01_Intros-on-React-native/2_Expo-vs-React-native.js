// Expo as React-native  it is vital topic for interview prospective.
/*
  Expo and React-native both frameworks are use for development of mobile applications for iOS and Android, but some key difference made the apart.

  1. With Expo creating a mobile application is a very rapid process, but how?
    when we use expo to create mobile apps it provides pre-configured development environment that is ease of maintenance, ease of set up and, platform compatibility.

  2. Whereas React-native is an open-source framework develop and maintain by facebook desing for building cross-platform native mobile application.

  3. On the other hand expo is independant open-source framework maintained by expo itself,  while they share this command goal their approches and additional features set them apart.

  4. Unlike React-native, which can we challenging and time-consuming to set-up. Expo provides a steamlined experience.

  5. The key advantages of expo is, its suite of tools and services built around react-native which greatly simplifies the development process, we can say that expo to react-native is similar to what nextjs is to react.

  6. There is one more huge advantage of using expo is, we can build iOS apps in either Windows machine or on Linux machine, but with plain react-native codebase we cannot build iOS apps wwithout having MacOS.

  7. Expo is evolving over year by year, and now supports nearly all the features necessary for building enterpise mobile apps.

  8. Although, in the event that where we do require access to Native Android or iOS code Expo allows us to eject our app and work with a plain react-native code base.
  This flexibility ensures that we have option to leverage the additional functionalitties provided by Expo while still retaining the ability to tap into native code when necessary.


  That's why in react-native official documentation they recommend expo as default choice for quick start.
