// What is StatusBar component?
/*

  The `StatusBar`component allows us to customize the status bar at the top of the app's screen, typically where the battery status, network information, wifi status or other app icons shows.

  By default the status bar is transparent and the content of the status bar will be in black on either devices whether it is android or ios. If we do not use the `StatusBar` component.

  If we do use the `StatusBar` component then its default background color in Android is black and in iOS will be transparent since iOS doesn't support status bar background color, but in the either platforms the icons color supports in Android its icon color will be in white and in iOS its icon color will be in black. 

  We can overrite the default apperence of the `StatusBar` component with its props.
  Let's see the `StatusBar` component in the `components` directory.
