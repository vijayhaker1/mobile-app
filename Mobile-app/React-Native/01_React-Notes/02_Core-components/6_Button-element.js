// What is Button component?
/*
  Button component in react-native is use to trigger actions similar to web-development button element.

  Although the `Button` component in react-native works similar to web button tag, its rendering is platform-specific, for iOS and Android-OS.

  Unlike in web-development button tag react-native's `Button` component is a self-closing element and to define the text for the button we use `title` prop.

  In web button tag we listen for click event with the help of `onClick` prop in react-native's `Button` component we use `onTouch` prop to listen click/button touch event.

  We can define color value for the `Button` component to customize colors, the color prop takes colour name as string.

  To disable the `Button` component we can use the `disable` prop this will disable the button and indicates the disabled button in gray-scale color. and by default the disable prop set to true.
